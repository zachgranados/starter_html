<h2>Riley</h2>
    <img src = "images/riley_primary.jpg" alt = "Apricot goldendoodle wearing blue bandana lying next to ball" width = 400>

<p> Riley is a 2yr old goldendoodle. He is very active and loves attention. Riley can be pretty mischievous; as such, his favorite activity is begging for (or stealing) food, however getting cuddled on a cool floor comes as a close second. In addition, Riley loves to walk in his local park or hang out with his best friend Cosmo.</p>

<p> Riley would NOT survive in the wild. He is very stubborn, jealous, and pampered. He is currently in his “terrible twos,” and must get everything his way. That said, Riley is loved by his family as a perfect, funny, and loyal dog. </p>

            <p>Bo is a Portuguese Water Dog with black and white fur. His paws are white too, so they always get dirty when outside. He is 12 years old, but he still likes to run around outside a lot.
            </p>
            <p>He has an abundance of toys but only likes to play with a couple. He enjoys going on walks and especially on trails in the woods. He has a few dog friends that he likes to go on playdates with as well.

            <h2>Cheeto (Chicken)</h2>

            <img src="images/cheeto_cattree.jpg"
            alt="Orange cat hanging paws off a cat tower" width="400">
            <p> Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get outside every single day. If he is not causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and sleeping.</p>
       
            <p>Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.

            <p>Pappy is a 7 year old morkie. Most days he prefers to spend it laying around the house in his various favorite spots. Most of the time you can find him lying in his bed. He loves going with walks, but still hasn’t figured out how to approach other dogs without scaring them off. He loves his family and loves to keep intruders away even for his size.</p>
            
            <p>He also enjoys playing with his favorite basketball. He loves pushing it around, scratching it, or even talking with it. He also loves his little stuffed animal too. Pappy also loves to be scratched and will ask you to keep scratching until he is happy.</p>

            <h2>Terry</h2>

            <img src = "images/terry_sitting.jpg" alt = "    Black dachshund wearing leash and sitting." width = 400>
        
            <p>Terry is a playful and spirited dachshund that loves to play fetch with his bone or tennis ball. He loves wandering in forests and finding large sticks to take home. His favorite foods are kibble and peanut butter. Terry will run around frantically when it’s time to eat at home.</p>

            <p>
                My family found Terry at a shelter and decided to adopt it. He was 4 months old and is now 8 years old. Terry knows how to swim, but we don’t tend to go often. Terry got poison ivy once; however, he quickly recovered and has been doing great since.
