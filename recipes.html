        <p>This recipe is a fantastic way to step up your pasta game without taking too much more of your time. It tastes way better than basic pasta with jarred sauce! I originally found this when my sister made it, and got the recipe off of Bon Appetit’s website. PS avoid using the shaker parmesan – I used that the first time I made this and it drew down the quality of the dish.</p>
